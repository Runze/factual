Locatoin search using Factual and interactive maps using Leaflet
=======

The project was documented in the blog post [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/08/location-search-using-factual-and-interactive-maps-using-leaflet.html) and the resulting app can be opened [here] (http://runzemc.shinyapps.io/factual/).

Many thanks to [Ramnath](https://github.com/ramnathv), his [rCharts](http://rcharts.io) pacakage, and his bike-sharing [app/tutorial](https://github.com/ramnathv/bikeshare).

The `data` folder includes the parsed place categories provided by [Factual](https://github.com/Factual/places/tree/master/categories) and the `package` directory includes all the non-standard Python modules used in the program (via [rPython](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rPython/rPython.pdf).).
